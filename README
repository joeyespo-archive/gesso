Gesso - Primer for your &lt;canvas&gt;
======================================

Because inspiration shouldn't be wasted on boilerplate.


Wait, what?
-----------

Gesso is a portable command-line utility that:

- Watches a directory tree, **collecting** assets and **compiling** modules on-the-fly
- Serves a website on `localhost` so you can see your work **without boilerplate**
- Allows you to **publish a single file** when you are finished

Any code changes you make are reflected immediately, with no page refresh required.


Let me try!
-----------

Install using [Node](http://nodejs.org):

    npm install -g gesso

Then start watching a directory by entering the following into a command window:

    cd <your-directory>
    gesso

When you see `Running on localhost:8080`, [visit the address](http://localhost:8080) for help with getting started.
